# git commit bot
A Git auto commit bot for busy developers

### Introduction
I made this bot for someone who is busy and wants to increase his/her GitHub contributions by pushing fake commits.
This version is console based. If you want to contribute, contact me so that we can even make a desktop app.

### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtwizeyimana/git-commit-bot
```

change directory

```bash
cd git-commit-bot
```
run Python file
```bash
python commitbot.py
```
Or use Python 3
```bash
python3 commitbot.py
```
Have fun!
